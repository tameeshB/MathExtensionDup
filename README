== MediaWiki ==

MediaWiki is a free and open-source wiki software package written in PHP. It
serves as the platform for Wikipedia and the other Wikimedia projects, used
by hundreds of millions of people each month. MediaWiki is localised in over
350 languages and its reliability and robust feature set have earned it a large
and vibrant community of third-party users and developers.

MediaWiki is:

* feature-rich and extensible, both on-wiki and with hundreds of extensions;
* scalable and suitable for both small and large sites;
* simple to install, working on most hardware/software combinations; and
* available in your language.

For system requirements, installation, and upgrade details, see the files
RELEASE-NOTES, INSTALL, and UPGRADE.

=======
This version (for MediaWiki 1.19) has some changes since previous versions:

* rendering options have been reduced to just 'Always PNG' and 'Leave it as TeX'
** all other rendering options will merge to PNG.
* initial experimental support for integrating MathJax client-side rendering

See the README in the math subdirectory for more info on setting up the
low-level conversion tools.
See the README in the texvccheck subdirectory for more info on setting up the
security checking tools for MathJax and LaTeXML.

MathML support:
If you prefer MathML rather than images you can use LaTeXML to convert the
math tags to MathML. To use that feature you have to enable LaTeXML by setting
$wgMathUseLaTeXML = true;
It is possible to choose LaTeXML as default option (for anonymous user) by setting
$wgDefaultUserOptions['math'] = 'latexml';
in the LocalSettings.php file.
The LaTeXML option requires php5-curl to be installed. Without php5-curl no proper
error handling can be guaranteed.
Furthermore, a core version of wmf/1.22wmf7 or newer is recommended.
Otherwise, errors in LaTeXML can lead to mal-formatted XML output and disturb the
page layout.

MathJax configuration:
Client-side configuration of MathJax can be done by specifying a mathJax.config
table, which takes a table as described in:
http://docs.mathjax.org/en/v1.1-latest/options/index.html#configuration

Example:
if ( typeof mathJax === 'undefined' ) {
  mathJax = {};
  mathJax.config = {
    showProcessingMessages: true
  };
}

Attributes of the <math /> element:
attribute "display":
possible values: "inline", "block" or "inline-displaystyle" (default)

"display" reproduces the old texvc behavior:
The equation is rendered with large height operands (texvc used $$ $tex $$ to render)
but the equation printed to the current line of the output and not centered in a new line.
In Wikipedia users use :<math>$tex</math> to move the math element closer to the center.

"inline" renders the equation in with small height operands by adding {\textstyle $tex } to the
users input ($tex). The equation is displayed in the current text line.

"inline-displaystyle" renders the equation in with large height operands centered in a new line by adding
{\displaystyle $tex } to the user input ($tex).


For testing your installation run
php tests/phpunit/phpunit.php extensions/Math/tests/
from your MediWiki home path.

== Logging ==
The math extension supports PSR-3 logging:
Configuration can be dona via
$wgDebugLogGroups['Math'] = [ 'level' => 'info', 'destination' => '/path/to/file.log' ];
